    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        shyFlix web application developed user the MERN stack, providing user with the ability to have access to movie information, as well as creating a list of favorite movies, while keeping track of genre, and director info. Users can create an account, add or remove favorites, update, and delete accounts.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
    <p>
        shyFlix app was built as part of my training with CareerFoundry for full stack web development. shyFlix was my introduction to JavaScript React.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project was to complete a full stack web application from scratch, while learning about the various nuances of creating a React application from both the client and server side aspects of building a web app.
    </p>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>I started by creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API interacts with a NoSQL database MongoDB. The API is accessed using commonly used CRUDE HTTP operation methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The data is provided in JSON format.</p>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
        To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.
    </p>
    <h2>Client Side Development</h2>
    <p>
        Building the client side that would be what the user sees (user interface) was built using React and included Redux. It provided a login and signup screen, a movie list with the ability to choose a movie, view its data, as well as add or remove them from a users favorite movies list. There is also a profile view that allows users to update the user info and delete their account.
    </p>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The project was one of the most informative projects that i worked on in my training. Some of the challenges i faces were understanding the testing process, testing it over and over again until i fully understood it using Postman. Understanding the concepts of endpoints on the back end and applying it to React using JSX syntax. AUthentication and password hashing, while understanding security protocol. Many of the challenges that i came across where solved by way reapplying and retesting, reading lots of documentation, as well as the awesome help and support i got from my tutor and mentor. This challenge set me up to better conquer the other tasks that where in involved in my training.
    </p>
    <h2>Duration</h2>
    <p>The server side was by far much more straight forward and easier to accomplish than React, as in React i had to cover many new things and ready lots of documentation and repeatedly reapply until it was complete. </p>
